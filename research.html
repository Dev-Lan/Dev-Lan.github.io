        For the summer of 2014 I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to perform research abroad at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes">Inria Rennes</a> under <a href="http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Julien.Pettre/">Julien Pettr√©.</a> This ended up being an education experience for me in many different domains of life. In terms of my academic pursuits the most prominent event was the chance to participate in the end process of publication. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2668094">Optimization-based computation of locomotion trajectories for crowd patches</a> became the first paper that I co-authored. I discovered a lot about the publication process while writing, editing and created diagrams for the paper. Most fondly I remember the late nights creating and editing a final video for our paper. As it turns out, the 3D visualization I hacked together for that video became an early inspiration for my multivariate trajectory visualization work. The rest of the summer I spent developing algorithms in C++ that expanded on those in the paper. I appreciate the practice I got, both technical and communicative from working within a larger project. However my favorite aspect of this job was ruminating on manipulating space-time paths both at and after work.

        The summer after my freshman year of college I was eager to begin my first experience with academic research. <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/">Stephen J. Guy</a> was gracious enough to take a green programmer such as me into his <a href="http://motion.cs.umn.edu/">Applied Motion Lab</a>. There I first learned the basics of representing motion programatically and utilized them by implementing a Python version of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ikaramouzas/pam">A Predictive Collision Avoidance Model for Pedestrian Simulation</a>. I spent the remainder of my time developing code in Python that would read in a crowd simulation and use <a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> to render a high quality video of the crowd. I thoroughly enjoyed creating a tool that people in the lab could use. Furthermore reading through the documentation of Mitsuba was my first foray into the world of computer graphics.
