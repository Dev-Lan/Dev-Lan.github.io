                        <h3>Preface</h3>
                        <p>
                        I've taken a long time to decide how I wanted to present the necessary information for this section. Part of me wants to just opt out of having a preface altogether. After all I can't remember the last time I've read that section of a textbook. But there are a few things which I feel are important to state in the off chance people I don't personally know end up using this web tutorial. Firstly about myself, at the time of starting this I'm a fourth year computer science student preparing to graduate in May 2016. I have enjoyed my collegiate education at the University of Minnesota and am passionate about computer science. I would like to share this passion with friends and strangers alike, and in the process hopefully demystify some aspects of the field. My goals in making this are twofold. Firstly I would like to continue working on my ability to communicate and teach complex technical ideas, especially to those outside the discipline. Next I would like this to be an effective web tutorial for exposing anyone with no prior experience to computer science. I think that you can learn these topics at any age, but I will be writing these lessons with roughly highschoolers and older in mind.
                        <p>
                        This latter motivation is so important to me because society is clearly moving towards a more digital world and yet there is a growing disparity in understanding between the creators of these technologies and those who use them. At first glance this may seem like a nonissue, but in my opinion it can have some nuanced and far-reaching consequences. In particular issues today involving personal information, cyber security, and data mining have only come about due to this new technology. In these lessons I will not be talking about any of these issues. My goal instead is to give a better understanding of the technology so that people can make more informed decisions themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Since this is my main motivation I have structured the lessons so that what I feel are the important concepts to this end are weighted more towards the beginning. As the lessons progress they will focus more on the nuts and bolts of programming. The more lessons you complete the more these concepts will be reinforced. Furthermore if you think you may be interested in programming as either your sole profession or to augment other skills progressing further will only give you more of an indication of what to expect.
