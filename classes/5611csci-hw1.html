  <h2>Assignment One : Particle Systems</h2>
  <p>For this assignment I created an array of different particle systems. A screenshot of each system is below as well as a video presentation of all systems with descriptions of each. One of my overarching goals for this assignment was to render the particle systems in a painterly fashion. My main strategy to this end was to use textures I created using <a href="https://www.artrage.com/">ArtRage</a>, a painting application, and dynamically use subsections of the texture for each glyph.</p>

  <h3>Tools used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>G3D (graphics engine) : <a href="https://g3d.sourceforge.net/">https://g3d.sourceforge.net/</a> </li>
      <p>This basically serves as a wrapper around openGL calls, and provides utility classes such as Vectors and Cameras. I still wrote all the shaders for this project as well as all of the particle system code.</p>
    <li>ArtRage (texture software) : <a href="https://www.artrage.com/">https://www.artrage.com/</a> </li>
      <p>I used this software to create all of the textures in this program with the exception of the ground plane.</p>
    <li>GroundTexture : <a href="https://opengameart.org/node/11950">https://opengameart.org/node/11950/</a> </li>
      <p>I used this nice open souce tileable ground texture.</p>
    <li>Normal Map Creation : <a href="https://www.crazybump.com/">https://www.crazybump.com/</a> </li>
      <p>This is a neat little program that creates normal maps from images. I used it on the ground texture to create a nice effect with phong shading.</p>

  <h3>Difficulties Encountered</h3>
  <p>The most surprising issue that I ran into was a problem I had with the speed of my fragment shader. Going into this I thought I would be able to use large paint themed glyphs, not use as many particles, and have a fast compelling animation. On The contrary I found when using larger particle sizes, especially when the camera had many particles in its viewport the framerate bombed. All that my fragment shader does is a texture lookup, so this surprised me. Instead of fixing the problem I ended up just using smaller particle sizes. I am still curious if there is a good way to fix this, but if I had to guess myself the best way to speed this up would be to clip the particles that are occluded by more forefront particles.</p>
