Questions:
* outlier < deepest - (deepest - thresholdDepth) * 1.5

* in the paper they expand the envelope of the functional band.



* O(n * M^3/ 2):

	for each row:
		for each value:
			countInclusions(value,row)

	countInclusions(value, row):
		count = 0
		for i in range(len(row)):
			v1 = row[i]
			for j in range(i+1, len(row)):
				v2 = row[j]
				low = min(v1,v2)
				high = max(v1,v2)
				if low <= value <= high:
					count += 1
* BD vs MBD -> I've been using MBD (shape vs outlier) the paper implied one was better for shape? I don't understand why exactly
* Really questions for NASA People:
	What are they trying to accomplish? Get a nice picture for publication?... for reference? Learn something from their data? Communicate something about their data?

* color plot file (not included in forwarded email)


* limitations:
* * uniformly sampled
* * functions defined across entire interval



* administrative:
* * commit to github
* * desk


* what is the paper / extension for 2D functions? 3D? Arbitrary higher dimensions?
* * Curve Boxplot: Generalization of Boxplot for Ensembles of Curves

* what's next?
* * tweak colors back
* * push envelope
* * how to compute (statistically - 
		bootstrapping methods (how good is sampling strategy)
		how good is my estimator

* * publishing
